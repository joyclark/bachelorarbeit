  abstract   = {We present ProB, an animation and model checking tool for the B
    method. ProB's animation facilities allow users to gain confidence in
    their specifications, and unlike the animator provided by the
    B-Toolkit, the user does not have to guess the right values for the
    operation arguments or choice variables. ProB contains a model checker
    and a constraint-based checker, both of which can be used to detect
    various errors in B specifications. We present our first experiences
    in using ProB on several case studies, highlighting that ProB enables
    users to uncover errors that are not easily discovered by existing
    tools.},
