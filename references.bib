  title      = {{ProB}: A Model Checker for {B}},
  abstract   = {We present ProB, an animation and model checking tool for the B
    method. ProB's animation facilities allow users to gain confidence in
    their specifications, and unlike the animator provided by the
    B-Toolkit, the user does not have to guess the right values for the
    operation arguments or choice variables. ProB contains a model checker
    and a constraint-based checker, both of which can be used to detect
    various errors in B specifications. We present our first experiences
    in using ProB on several case studies, highlighting that ProB enables
    users to uncover errors that are not easily discovered by existing
    tools.},

  title      = {Visualising Larger State Spaces in {ProB}},
  booktitle  = {ZB},
  abstract   = {ProB is an animator and model checker for the B method. It also allows
    to visualise the state space of a B machine in graphical way. This is
    often very useful and allows users to quickly spot whether the machine
    behaves as expected. However, for larger state spaces the
    visualisation quickly becomes difficult to grasp by users (and the
    computation of the graph layout takes considerable time). In this
    paper we present two relatively simple algorithms to often
    considerably reduce the complexity of the graphs, while still keeping
    relevant information. This makes it possible to visualise much larger
    state spaces and gives the user immediate feedback about the overall
    behaviour of a machine. The algorithms have been implemented within
    the ProB toolset and we highlight their potential on several examples.
    We also conduct a thorough experimentation of the algorithm on 47 B
    machines and analyse the results.},
