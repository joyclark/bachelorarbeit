\section{Future Work}

One of the main features we implemented in this work was the creation of a visualization framework. We have attempted to make the elements used for the visualization engines and the visualizations extensible. It should now be relatively simple to create new visualizations and integrate them into the existing visualization framework.

In the future, we will use this basis to create other useful visualizations for the user. ProB 2.0 still does not have all of the visualizations that are available in the Tcl/Tk version of ProB. For instance, we still need to implement the graphical visualization of a state within ProB 2.0. We will also likely create a visualization of the refinement hierarchy that is present in Classical B and Event-B models.

One of the projects in ProB 2.0 that is currently underway is the development of a worksheet element. This will serve as documentation and a means to run groovy scripts within the application. In the future, it should be possible to embed the visualizations created in the scope of this work within the worksheet element. 

Because time was limited during the course of this work, we have not had the time to implement all of the features that we would have liked to implement for all of the visualizaitons. Future features for the existing visualizations could include:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Support for the visualization of formulas in specification languages other than Classical B and Event-B.
	\item Redefinition of the element ids for the Formula and Value Over Time visualizations so that it is easier for the user to customize the appearance of the visualizations.
	\item Introduction of a better mechanism to manage (i.e. add and remove) formulas from the Value Over Time visualization.

\end{itemize}
