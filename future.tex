\section{Future Work}

This work has created graphic visualizations using the d3 Javascript library. The same framework can be used to create other visualizations for other needs. For instance, there is no graphical representation of a state in the ProB 2.0 API. One future project could be to create a graphical representation of this state.

It is also possible to adapt the new visualizations in order to add functionality. For instance, in order to view the information about a particular state within the state space, it would make sense to combine the state space visualization with the proposed state visualization. Then, when a state is clicked on within the state space visualization, a window could pop up displaying the state visualization for that particular state.
